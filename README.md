# :dart: AI project management
The goal of this repo is to share all tasks and topics that we should take care of, when it comes to AI project management.

Here we take the example of Fashion-Insta, a fictitious european company in the fashion industry.

The Product Team aims to provide a Mobile App which recommends clothings to their customers, and to launch the App in Italy.

This Mobile App should allow users to take pictures of themselves with their favorite clothes, and in return, they get recommendations of items of the **same clothing style**.
